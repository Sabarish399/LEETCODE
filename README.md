# LeetCode Progress Tracker  

## Introduction  
This repo is where I keep track of my **LeetCode practice**. I solve problems daily, upload the solutions, and note down my approach in a simple format.  

## Goals  
- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Get better at **data structures and algorithms**  
- Prepare for coding interviews  
- Stay consistent with daily practice  

## Structure  
- Problems are grouped into **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** folders.  
- Each file has:  
  - Problem number & name  
  - Link to the problem  
  - Approach in simple words  
  - Time & Space complexity  

## How to Use  
- Go to the right folder (Easy/Medium/Hard).  
- Open the file to see the solution and explanation.  
- Use this repo as a reference or for your own practice.
