# LeetCode Progress Tracker

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This repository is dedicated to logging my progress on **LeetCode** as I practice solving coding challenges. It serves as a space to document solutions, track improvement, and share approaches to various problems.

## ðŸŽ¯ About
The main goals of this repository are:
- Strengthening problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  
- Building a strong foundation for **coding interviews** and technical assessments.  
- Tracking my journey as a 2nd-year engineering student exploring **data structures and algorithms**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Difficulty**: Problems are categorized into **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** folders.  
- **Topics** *(optional expansion later)*: Sub-categories like Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, etc.  
- **Format**: Each solution file may contain:
  - The **problem statement/summary**.  
  - The **code solution** (Java/Python/other).  
  - An **explanation** of the approach and reasoning.
